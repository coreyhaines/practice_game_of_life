Coderetreat is a day-long, intensive practice event, focusing on the fundamentals of software development and modular design, primarily the [4 Rules of Simple Design](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?XpSimplicityRules):

1. Tests Pass (green)
2. Reveal Intent (good names)
3. No Duplication (DRY)
4. Small


## Wikipedia: [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The "game" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.
