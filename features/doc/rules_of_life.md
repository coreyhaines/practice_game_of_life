Based on Wikipedia: Conway's Game of Life: [Rules](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules)

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square *cells*, each of which is in one of two possible states, *alive* or *dead*. Every cell interacts with its eight *neighbors*, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

### 1. Under-Population
- Any live cell with *fewer than 2* live neighbors *dies*

### 2. Next Generation
- Any live cell with *2 or 3* live neighbors *lives* on

### 3. Overcrowding
- Any live cell with *more than 3* live neighbors *dies*

### 4. Reproduction
- Any dead cell with *exactly 3* live neighbors becomes a *live* cell

The initial pattern constitutes the *seed* of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a *tick* (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.
